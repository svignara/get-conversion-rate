# get-conversion-rate
Simple API that will get the conversion rate from one currency to another

---

### TODO:
* API documentation
* ~~Rename route `/api/convert` to `/api/conversion_rate`~~ no need for this (see note below for why)
* ~~Create new `/api/convert` route that accepts a `fromCntry`, `toCntry` and `value` (of the `fromCntry`) as parameters and responds back with converted `value` (of the `toCntry`).~~ forgot I'm just passing the search to google, so google can handle if I pass a value, and will return the correct converted value
