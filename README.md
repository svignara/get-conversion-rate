# get-conversion-rate
Simple API that will get the conversion rate from one currency to another

---

### TODO:
* API documentation
* Rename route `/api/convert` to `/api/conversion_rate`
* Create new `/api/convert` route that accepts a `fromCntry`, `toCntry` and `value` (of the `fromCntry`) as parameters and responds back with converted `value` (of the `toCntry`).
